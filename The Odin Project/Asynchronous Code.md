# Asynchronous Code
## Introduction
Since JavaScript is the language of the web, there are some functions that by necessity are going to take a decent amount of time to complete, such as fetching data from a server to disply on your site. For this reason, JavaScript includes support for asynchronous functions, or to put it another way, functions that can happen in the background while the rest of your code executes. 

## Learning Outcomes
- Explain: 
- [ ] what a callback is
- [ ] what a promise is
- [ ] The circumstances under which promises are better than callbacks
- [ ] What the .then() function does

## Callbacks
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action
